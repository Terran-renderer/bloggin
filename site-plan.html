      <p>[This is a simple idea for a blog site. I plan to include some form of backup filing system if possible. It is for my older sister who writes daily. This will hopefully be a good way for people to read daily excerpts from what she writes.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[Writers, anyone who writes daily would idealy be able to use this.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        This is a project for my sister who writes all the time. It is supposed to be a personal website for her to display her work effectively and to be copied and 
        developed later by me for a more full website idea. It will have a mostly simple function and some complex ones. The main idea however is to make it automatically be updated.
        She can write in Google Docs or whatever and it automatically add an entry and display it on the front page. Then it will archive the old ones into  google probably so 
        they can be accessed later.

        <p>
          The home page will contain the preview and an about me secition. It will also contain working socials links. Ity's important that it naturally leads the user to read mroe and to follow 
          the wormhole essentially. Speaking of socials, it will also contain links to a lot of hwer writing contained in other websites too.

        <p>
          Page 2 is the current project that you see in the preview so now you can read the whole thing. I want to allow space for artwork on the side as my sister is also an artist.
          This one just needs to look asthetically pleasing as this will be the majority of time spent. It shoulkd be simple and straightforward.

      <h3>Archives</h3>
      <p>         
        <p>
          Page 3 is the "Archive Page," this one will take a lot of scripting to get working to be honest. It is a simple archive for the site, and will be categorized by date. Most current to Least current.
          It is vital that this is easy to use and works all the time. Each bar will pull up the corresponding page.

          Page 4 is the pulled up old project, I'd like to get it so it also pulls the old artwork so it loks the same. I will probably format it as HTML code in google and see if I can pull that and push it to the page.
