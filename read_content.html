            <p>Random Chunk of Gray’s Writing: 

                Snippet of She Who Dances With Death
                Gray L. Crisp
                
                Chapter 5: Abrem 3 | Day 6 @ 10 am 
                
                “What are you doing in here?”
                Abrem looked up from the registry on Cyrano’s desk he’d been leafing through to see the man himself come waltzing in. “What are you doing in here?” He said distractedly, going back to his task. 
                He could hear Cyrano’s scoff from all the way across the room. “Uh, this is kind of my office?” his brother said as if unsure. 
                Abrem sighed, putting the registry down harder than strictly necessary, catching Cyrano’s eyes as he jerked his chin up and away from the book. “I suppose so,” he muttered, not quite making eye contact anymore. 
                “Something I can help you with?” Cyrano walked over to him, glancing curiously at the registry. 
                “Why would I need help with something?” he grumbled, looking at Cyrano’s forehead, using the trick he’d learned ages ago. 
                “Because we have the same face,” Cyrano said flatly. “And that’s what my face looks like when I need help with something. So? What’s going on?”
                Abrem finally decided to show at least one of his cards. “Do you know anyone named Zenith? I don’t have a last name. Or, I guess it could be either. I don’t have another name,” he amended.  
                Cyrano pursed his lips, leaning onto the edge of the desk. “No, I don’t think so; should I?” 
                Abrem shook his head, annoyed at himself. “It might have to do with flour imports, since he’s supposedly from Selcia.”  
                Pushing off of the lip of the desk, Cyrano shrugged. “Maybe,” he said noncommittally. 
                “But that doesn’t make any sense!” Abrem shouted. 
                His brother looked startled by his outburst. “What doesn’t make sense?” 
                “Flour imports,” he stressed, throwing his hands up. 
                Cyrano’s eyebrow raise wasn’t exactly reassuring in the slightest. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
                Abrem frowned, backing his train of thoughts up. “I mean, I already closed the deal with Vodde and Cheliss, like, last week,” he tried to explain. “There shouldn’t be anyone else involved, and if there was, neither of them mentioned him.” 
                Cyrano yawned as if talking to his twin was the most boring task he had going on for him at the moment. “Maybe Selcia changed their minds? Sent a new person?” 
                “But that’s the thing,” Abrem insisted, not knowing what information needed to be said to provide enough context. “He’s not here yet. He’s supposed to be here in time for the ball, but why then? Why is that the deadline?” 
                Cyrano looked bored as he came around the desk to the side Abrem stood on. “...and…you’re asking the guy who just said he doesn't even know who that is?” 
                “No,” Abrem grumbled, shuffling aside to let him sit in his desk chair. “I’m just asking the world in general.” 
                “Well, considering the world isn’t here but I am, color me surprised,” Cyrano said flippantly, sitting down heavily. 
                Abrem rolled his eyes, stepping around the desk so they’d traded places. “You know what I meant,” he snapped. 
                “Are you overstimulated? What’s going on with you?” Cyrano asked, staring at him now. 
                “Nothing’s going on with me,” Abrem lied defensively. “And what does me being overstimulated have to do with anything?” 
                Cyrano looked a little taken aback. “...because you’re acting really grouchy? And that usually means you can hear or feel or see something that’s too much for you.” 
                Abrem’s eyebrows scrunched in surprise. “How do you know that?” 
                Cyrano laughed. “Because I know you as well as I know myself? What kind of question is that?” 
                Abrem scowled, heading for the door. “I didn’t realize you…would care so much about that,” he came up with. 
                Cyrano shrugged again, looking down at the disorganized papers on cocoa imports Abrem had disrupted to stack them again. “Maybe I care about people other than myself. I know, wild.” 
                Abrem had never been the best at picking up sarcasm, but this seemed too obvious to miss. “Ha ha,” he shot back, leaving the room instead of responding reasonably. He paused by the now closed door, trying to decide his next course of action.  
                Zenith’s identity and purpose for coming here remained a mystery for now, but…maybe he could make it less of a mystery. He knew his mother knew, of course, but he couldn’t exactly ask her— 
                But maybe he could ask her records. From her office. 
                He mulled his vague questions over all the way to Queen Tsarina’s office. He paused outside her door while he tried the doorknob, finding it, to his disappointment, completely locked. 
                He groaned loudly. If he were playing chess, he wouldn’t just be missing half his pieces, he’d be missing half the board. “So,” he mused aloud. “How to get in?” 
                He tried the doorknob again, as if it would’ve unlocked in the five seconds since he’d last tried it. Locking doorknobs were a wonderful invention on a good day in the right situations. 
                But when he was trying to break into his mother’s office to find any documents that existed about Zenith…well, they were much more of a nuisance. 
                Abrem stopped twisting the knob. Tsarina only locked her doors every once in a while, he knew, so this just happened to be a time when she had. She kept her keys on a solid metal ring they’d been welded onto. 
                But where would she keep such a thing? In her skirt pockets on her person? In her bedroom? With a servant? 
                A servant! 
                He knew what a few of Tsarina’s personal servants looked like, but only knew two names: Realia and Dami. 
                One of them was a man, and one of them was a woman, but which was which was pretty up for debate. He’d only ever heard them summoned together. Never one at a time. 
                Turning on his heel, he darted down the stairs to the first floor. He passed an inordinate amount of servants going about doing many mundane tasks—except for a stony faced man who looked like one of the pair. 
                He gave it a shot. “Hey!” His voice cracked but he stood his ground, beckoning the bewildered servant to him. The other man gazed around, looking for someone else the prince might be talking to. Finding no one else in his vicinity, the wide-eyed man stumbled toward him. 
                “Relax,” Abrem smiled, trying to set him at ease. “Are you…Realia?” 
                His face took on an oddly dark cloud before clearing entirely as he spoke in a rough voice that stayed deceptively higher than Abrem would’ve pegged him for. “I know where Realia is,” he said softly, making Abrem realize that his shot in the dark had been entirely wrong. “Would you like me to fetch her for you?” The young man’s tone made it sound as though Abrem should have known this information already. 
                And maybe he should have. 
                “No,” he said quickly. “You’ll do just fine. And your name is?” he asked, as if he didn’t know.
                “...Dami,” the soft-spoken man whispered, as if expecting to be flogged for introducing himself. 
                “Alright, Dami,” Abrem said brightly. “Can you tell me where Queen Tsarina’s keys are? For her parlor room and bedroom and the like?” 
                Dami’s eyes narrowed. He looked at Abrem with an oddly specific expression he didn’t know the meaning of. “I’m sorry, Prince Cyrano; I don’t know.” 
                Abrem started. He’d plumb forgotten that some servants didn’t know he existed. That explained Dami’s confusion. It seemed Cyrano had already met Dami. “Can you find out for me?” 
                Dami stared at him with a look of barely hidden disgust that Abrem didn’t know if he’d earned. “Of course,” he said curtly, spinning on his heel and striding confidently down the first floor west wing, turning down the north hall to find Tsarina’s keys, hopefully. 
                He wanted to stick as close to Dami as possible so that when the servant did, in fact, find Tsarina’s keys, he would sooner meet up with Abrem than Cyrano. 
                So when Dami’s figure continued down the hall, climbing up a flight of stairs to get back to the second floor, where Tsarina’s bedroom and private parlor were, Abrem followed. 
                He turned down the next hall. 
                Abrem crept after him quickly. 
                But Dami had disappeared by that point. He was nowhere in sight down the north hall. 
                Abrem sidled up against the closed door of Tsarina’s bedroom. Whether it was locked or not was irrelevant, because he needed to be quiet now. 
                Voices in Tsarina’s bedroom gained volume, but he couldn’t be certain how much was just rising tension and how much of it meant they were getting closer to the closed door. 
                He backed up quickly, entering the next door down. It led to a small guest bedroom he hadn’t even known existed in this hall. He kept the door cracked open just enough that he could overhear as much of the conversation turned argument as possible without exposing himself to the occupants of the next room. 
                Finally, he laid down on the floor by the door of this guest bedroom, pressing an ear just past the doorframe he laid up against. 
                “—doesn’t know, won’t know—” 
                “—asked me, but I—” 
                “—you dare tell me to—?” 
                The voices’ volume escalated to where he acutely recognized the higher one. Whether it belonged to his mother or a servant, he couldn’t say; the murmurs were barely audible at the moment. He barely registered any of the words as Common tongue, let alone who spoke them. 
                “—find out. If he finds out, this will be entirely—” 
                “—won’t. He’s far too stupid and—” 
                “—banking on how stupid you think he is—” 
                “—clever—” 
                “—not—” 
                “—girl—” 
                Abrem adjusted his position to be less cramped, but lost a few possibly crucial words in the process. 
                “—clean up—” 
                “—locked—” 
                “—out. Get out.” 
                The conversation ended abruptly with the sound of a loud smack filling the air. But whether it had been against someone’s face or not, he had no idea. 
                The clicking of steel heeled shoes—that he thought to be wonderfully uncomfortable to make or wear—drowned out the feeble protests that passed by his door, as if the heavy shoed person wanted to chase the other person down the hallway. 
                “—Cyrano, but you knew that, didn’t you?” 
                “—didn't give him any hints, he has no—!” 
                “—need hints, he’s a sharper knife than—” 
                “—smart enough to—” 
                “—enough. Enough. Get out of my sight. And don’t you dare come back without—!” Tsarina bellowed, her last few words drowned out by the slamming of a door somewhere near him. 
                He held his breath, leaning forward to pull the door open. 
                “Done eavesdropping?” 
                Abrem thought he’d had a blood blocking attack the way his heart jumped out of his throat in a strangled cry. 
                The voice belonged to someone with an odd accent—Selciac? Gervukian?—and a tired raspy throat that seemed painful to push words through. He’d never heard anyone with such thick inflections on the ends of words that he didn’t think should have had inflections on the ends. 
                He thought it might’ve sounded similar to the Gervukian chancellors if they’d had severely stuffy noses while bargaining the size of their exports. 
                Still, it sounded…familiar. The half whisper, at least. It tinkled a little bell in the back of his brain. The harsh vowels tickled his memories, but he could not place it yet. 
                The speaker flicked on the light in the small room they shared.
                Abrem blinked rapidly, the harsh shine watering his eyes. He peered through the brightness to see the other of Tsarina’s dynamic duo of servants, Realia. 
                Had she been in this room the entire time? 
                His face burned. 
                “Uh, well, you see…it’s…it’s just that—” he started, but she cut him off. 
                “You’re not Cyrano, then. You’re Abram.” 
                Abrem was less miffed—which was the first emotion to come to play—and more so confused why she knew who he was. How she had even the vaguest idea that he existed. Considering how well protected that whole secret was, after all. How well protected it was supposed to be. “Abrem,” he said absently, scrutinizing her whole attire. She wore the servant's garb strangely, like she wasn’t certain how she should’ve been tying her apron strings in front of her. “How…did Tsarina tell you?” 
                Realia looked suddenly supremely uncomfortable. “Yes,” she said entirely too quickly. 
                He narrowed his eyes at the blatant lie, but did nothing more. He had no proof. Maybe this was just instinctual bullshit on his part. 
                She spoke again; slower, and in a hushed voice. “What do you do with your time?” 
                Abrem scoffed, wondering if it was a joke. He sat flat on the floor, blocking the now closed door. “Pretend to be Cyrano,” he said shortly. 
                Realia laughed. “Of course! But what do you do for fun?” 
                Abrem stared at her, unsure of how to respond. Was this some sort of test? “...I make clothes,” he said haltingly. 
                Realia gave such a sharp squeal, he had to clap his hands over his ears to block out the rising pitch at the end. “Ah! A fashion bug bit you then,” she said dreamily, stumbling over the idiom. “When? Do you sell them? What kind?” 
                Abrem, caught off guard by the questions no one had ever bothered to ask him, stammered out, “Uh, I do…I do sell them; shoes,” he said excitedly before realizing that she could tell his mother. She was one of her closest servants. Anything he said could be—and probably would be—relayed back to Tsarina. 
                He clamped his mouth shut, physically biting his tongue. 
                Realia, seeing this, seemed to find it rather amusing. She laughed, clear as one of Cyrano's bored whistles. “We all have our secrets. But it’s not yours that you should be worried about.” 
                He stared at her. “...what? What does that mean?” 
                Realia’s face drained almost entirely, which he found to be quite the feat, considering how pale she was to begin with. Then she nervously laughed it off. “Nothing, of course. Slip of the tongue. Is that how you say it?” 
                “Yeah, slip of the tongue,” Abrem muttered his agreement for her use of the idiom. 
                She said nothing more, staring down at him, wordlessly asking for him to move his ass. 
                He moved his ass, unsure why she’d need to be so secretive about what he could only assume to be the secret she’d been talking about that he should be more concerned about. 
                She stared at him for a dreary moment, as if she wanted to say more. 
                But she apparently thought better of it, leaving without another word. 
                The door closed silently behind her.  
                But she didn’t need to speak again for his brain to finally place her uniquely constructed accent. 
                “The other room!” he said suddenly, in the middle of standing and dusting the seat of his pants off. Three—? Two days, it had been two days ago. But then, if it was Realia, who had been the man threatening her? The other familiar voice hadn’t been Dami, because he'd never heard the man speak until ten minutes ago. 
                Another servant? What kind of secret could another servant blackmail her with that would make her so…obviously afraid? 
                Maybe it had to do with Zenith. Maybe Realia knew who Zenith was. She was one of Tsarina’s personal servants, after all, and Tsarina knew who Zenith was. 
                Even if only through osmosis, surely Realia had some inkling as to the identity of this Selciac person. 
                He should’ve asked her! When precisely in the conversation he should have slipped it in there, he didn’t even know, but she could potentially know something that would solve this entire mystery. Couldn’t she?
                Oh, he didn’t know. 
                He hated not knowing. 
                He sighed, exhausted. From what, he didn’t know that either. 
                But even his bones felt sore.
