          Snippet of She Who Dances With Death
          Gray L. Crisp
          
          Chapter 5: Abrem 3 | Day 6 @ 10 am 
          
          “What are you doing in here?”
          Abrem looked up from the registry on Cyrano’s desk he’d been leafing through to see the man himself come waltzing in. “What are you doing in here?” He said distractedly, going back to his task. 
          He could hear Cyrano’s scoff from all the way across the room. “Uh, this is kind of my office?” his brother said as if unsure. 
          Abrem sighed, putting the registry down harder than strictly necessary, catching Cyrano’s eyes as he jerked his chin up and away from the book. “I suppose so,” he muttered, not quite making eye contact anymore. 
          “Something I can help you with?” Cyrano walked over to him, glancing curiously at the registry. 
          “Why would I need help with something?” he grumbled, looking at Cyrano’s forehead, using the trick he’d learned ages ago. 
          “Because we have the same face,” Cyrano said flatly. “And that’s what my face looks like when I need help with something. So? What’s going on?”
          Abrem finally decided to show at least one of his cards. “Do you know anyone named Zenith? I don’t have a last name. Or, I guess it could be either. I don’t have another name,” he amended.  
          Cyrano pursed his lips, leaning onto the edge of the desk. “No, I don’t think so; should I?” 
          Abrem shook his head, annoyed at himself. “It might have to do with flour imports, since he’s supposedly from Selcia.”  
          Pushing off of the lip of the desk, Cyrano shrugged. “Maybe,” he said noncommittally. 
          “But that doesn’t make any sense!” Abrem shouted. 
          His brother looked startled by his outburst. “What doesn’t make sense?” 
          “Flour imports,” he stressed, throwing his hands up. 
          Cyrano’s eyebrow raise wasn’t exactly reassuring in the slightest. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
          Abrem frowned, backing his train of thoughts up. “I mean, I already closed the deal with Vodde and Cheliss, like, last week,” he tried to explain. “There shouldn’t be anyone else involved, and if there was, neither of them mentioned him.” 
          Cyrano yawned as if talking to his twin was the most boring task he had going on for him at the moment. “Maybe Selcia changed their minds? Sent a new person?” 
          “But that’s the thing,” Abrem insisted, not knowing what information needed to be said to provide enough context. “He’s not here yet. He’s supposed to be here in time for the ball, but why then? Why is that the deadline?” 
          Cyrano looked bored as he came around the desk to the side Abrem stood on. “...and…you’re asking the guy who just said he doesn't even know who that is?” 
          “No,” Abrem grumbled, shuffling aside to let him sit in his desk chair. “I’m just asking the world in general.” 
          “Well, considering the world isn’t here but I am, color me surprised,” Cyrano said flippantly, sitting down heavily. 
          Abrem rolled his eyes, stepping around the desk so they’d traded places. “You know what I meant,” he snapped. 
          “Are you overstimulated? What’s going on with you?” Cyrano asked, staring at him now.
